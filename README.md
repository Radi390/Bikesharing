### Which hours and days customers most likely to use a bike?

However, it isn't as active as weekdays pick hours. These trips, most of the time, occurred by daily renters.

### Trip Duration
As we see, most trips are less than 10 minutes for both men and women, and it seems that they've ridden down specific streets every workday to and fro their work location, and they choose to ride bikes for short distances. However, those with Unknown Gender that we already know most of them are tourists who want to have a fun trip at the weekend were riding bikes for longer distances.
